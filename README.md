# Kaalrav
This repository presents a new or let's say a prototype version of kalraav.in that is published by SMIT. Not me.

# What is Kaalrav?
Kaalrav is the annual techno-cultural festival of Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Majitar, Sikkim, India. Started in the year 2001, it is one of the largest college festivals held in North-East India. From extravagant dance to mind-bending music to invigorating drama to originative fashion to aesthetic art to abstract literature to innovative engineering, Kaalrav has it all, the life breathing into the air of SMIT. With thousands of participants, more than a hundred exciting events, it is 3 days of amusement when the silence breaks to cheers of joy. It witnesses the clash of some of the brightest minds of our country paving way to the discovery of champions every year.

# Sponsors?
Well as it is a one of the largest college festival then so is the sponsors like, Gaana, Sunburn and more.

# What's the motive of doing this?
Recreating the website is just for education purpose but when spent time in scrolling the website (kaalrav.in) I found a lot of bugs and error on some parts of the website let's say in the scalling, scrolling, padding, margin, UI/UX interface and design and more. So, to correct the mistakes in here I am wanting to recreate the art and make it looks and feel like a real kaalrav website.

## Let's See! ☺️
